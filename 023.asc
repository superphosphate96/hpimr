//Everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around J. K. Rowling.

// 4405
//“And then Janet was a Squib,” said the portrait of a short young woman with a
//gold-trimmed hat.

// 4406
//Draco wrote it down. That was only twenty-eight but it was time to go back and
//meet Harry.

// 4407
//He’d needed to ask other portraits to help translating, English had changed a
//lot, but the oldest portraits had described first-year spells that sounded an
//awful lot like the ones they had now. Draco had recognized around half of them
//and the other half didn’t sound any more powerful.

// 4408
//The sick feeling in his stomach had grown with each answer until finally,
//unable to take it any more, he’d gone off and asked other portraits Harry
//Potter’s strange question about Squib marriages, instead. The first five
//portraits hadn’t known anyone and finally he’d asked those portraits to ask
//__their__ acquaintances to ask __their__ acquaintances and so managed
//to find some people who’d actually admit to being friends with Squibs.

// 4409
//(The first-year Slytherin had explained he was working on an important project
//with a Ravenclaw and the Ravenclaw had told him they needed this information
//and then run off without saying why. This had garnered many sympathetic looks.)

// 4410
//Draco’s feet were heavy as he walked through the corridors of Hogwarts. He
//should have been running but he couldn’t seem to muster the energy. He kept on
//thinking that he didn’t want to know about this, he didn’t want to be involved
//in any of this, he didn’t want this to be his responsibility, just let Harry
//Potter do it, if magic was fading let Harry Potter take care of it…

// 4411
//But Draco knew that wasn’t right.

// 4412
//Chill the dungeons of Slytherin, gray the stone walls, Draco usually liked the
//atmosphere, but now it seemed too much like fading.

// 4413
//His hand on the doorknob, Harry Potter already inside and waiting, wearing his
//cowled cloak.

// 4414
//“The ancient first-year spells,” Harry Potter said. “What did you find?”

// 4415
//“They’re no more powerful than the spells we use now.”

// 4416
//Harry Potter’s fist struck a desk, hard. “Damn it. All right. My own experiment
//was a failure, Draco. There’s something called the Interdict of Merlin -”

// 4417
//Draco hit himself on the forehead, realizing.

// 4418
//“- which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells out of books,
//even if you find and read a powerful wizard’s notes they won’t make sense to
//you, it has to go from one living mind to another. I couldn’t find any powerful
//spells that we had the instructions for but couldn’t cast. But if you can’t get
//them out of old books, why would anyone bother passing them on by word of mouth
//after they stopped working? Did you get the data on the Squib couples?”

// 4419
//Draco started to hand the parchment over -

// 4420
//But Harry Potter held up a hand. “Law of science, Draco. First I tell you the
//theory and the prediction. Then you show me the data. That way you know I’m not
//just making up a theory to fit; you know that the theory actually predicted the
//data in __advance.__ I have to explain this to you anyway, so I have to
//explain it __before__ you show me the data. That’s the rule. So put on
//your cloak and let’s sit down.”

// 4421
//Harry Potter sat down at a desk with torn scraps of paper arranged across its
//surface. Draco drew his cloak out of his bookbag, drew it on, and sat down
//across from Harry on the other side, giving the paper scraps a puzzled look.
//They were arranged in two rows and the rows were about twenty scraps long.

// 4422
//“The secret of blood,” said Harry Potter, an intense look on his face, “is
//something called deoxyribonucleic acid. You don’t say that name in front of
//anyone who’s not a scientist. Deoxyribonucleic acid is the recipe that tells
//your body how to grow, two legs, two arms, short or tall, whether you have
//brown eyes or green. It’s a material thing, you can __see__ it if you have
//microscopes, which are like telescopes only they look at things that are very
//small instead of very far away. And that recipe has two copies of everything,
//always, in case one copy is broken. Imagine two long rows of pieces of paper.
//At each place in the row, there are two pieces of paper, and when you have
//children, your body selects one piece of paper at random from each place in the
//row, and the mother’s body will do the same, and so the child also gets two
//pieces of paper at each place in the row. Two copies of everything, one from
//your mother, one from your father, and when you have children they get one
//piece of paper from you at random in each place.”

// 4423
//As Harry spoke, his fingers ranged over the paired scraps of paper, pointing to
//one part of the pair when he said “from your mother”, the other when he said
//“from your father”. And as Harry talked about picking a piece of paper at
//random, his hand pulled a Knut out of his robes and flipped it; Harry looked at
//the coin, and then pointed to the top piece of paper. All without a pause in
//the speech.

// 4424
//“Now when it comes to something like being short or tall, there’s a
//__lot__ of places in the recipe that make __little__ differences. So
//if a tall father marries a short mother, the child gets some pieces of paper
//saying ‘tall’ and some pieces of paper saying ‘short’, and usually the child
//ends up middle-sized. But not always. By luck, the child might get a lot of
//pieces saying ‘tall’, and not many papers saying ‘short’, and grow up pretty
//tall. You could have a tall father with five papers saying ‘tall’ and a tall
//mother with five papers saying ‘tall’ and by amazing luck the child gets
//__all ten__ papers saying ‘tall’ and ends up taller than both of them. You
//see? Blood isn’t a perfect fluid, it doesn’t mix perfectly. Deoxyribonucleic
//acid is made up of lots of little pieces, like a glass of pebbles instead of a
//glass of water. That’s why a child isn’t always exactly in the middle of the
//parents.”

// 4425
//Draco listened with his mouth open. How in Merlin’s name had the Muggles
//figured all this out? They could __see__ the recipe?

// 4426
//“Now,” Harry Potter said, “suppose that, just like with tallness, there’s lots
//of little places in the recipe where you can have a piece of paper that says
//‘magic’ or ‘not magic’. If you have enough pieces of paper saying ‘magic’
//you’re a wizard, if you have a __lot__ of pieces of paper you’re a
//powerful wizard, if you have too few you’re a Muggle, and in between you’re a
//Squib. Then, when two Squibs marry, most of the time the children should also
//be Squibs, but once in a while a child will get lucky and get most of the
//father’s magic papers __and__ most of the mother’s magic papers, and be
//strong enough to be a wizard. But probably not a very powerful one. If you
//started out with a lot of powerful wizards and they married only each other,
//they would stay powerful. But if they started marrying Muggleborns who were
//just barely magical, or Squibs… you see? The blood wouldn’t mix perfectly, it
//would be a glass of pebbles, not a glass of water, because that’s just the way
//blood works. There would still be powerful wizards now and then, when they got
//a lot of magic papers by luck. But they wouldn’t be as powerful as the most
//powerful wizards from earlier.”

// 4427
//Draco nodded slowly. He’d never heard it explained that way before. There was a
//surprising beauty to how exactly it fit.

// 4428
//“__But,__” Harry said. “That’s only __one__ hypothesis. Suppose that
//instead there’s only a __single__ place in the recipe that makes you a
//wizard. Only __one__ place where a piece of paper can say ‘magic’ or ‘not
//magic’. And there are two copies of everything, always. So then there are only
//three possibilities. Both copies can say ‘magic’. One copy can say ‘magic’ and
//one copy can say ‘not magic’. Or both copies can say ‘not magic’. Wizards,
//Squibs, and Muggles. Two copies and you can cast spells, one copy and you can
//still use potions or magic devices, and zero copies means you might even have
//trouble looking straight at magic. Muggleborns wouldn’t really be born to
//Muggles, they would be born to two Squibs, two parents each with one magic copy
//who’d grown up in the Muggle world. Now imagine a witch marries a Squib. Each
//child will get one paper saying ‘magic’ from the mother, always, it doesn’t
//matter which piece gets picked at random, both say ‘magic’. But like flipping a
//coin, half the time the child will get a paper saying ‘magic’ from the father,
//and half the time the child will get the father’s paper saying ‘not magic’.
//When a witch marries a Squib, the result won’t be a lot of weak wizarding
//children. Half the children will be wizards and witches just as powerful as
//their mother, and half the children will be Squibs. Because if there’s just
//__one__ place in the recipe that makes you a wizard, then magic isn’t like
//a glass of pebbles that can mix. It’s like a single magical pebble, a
//sorcerer’s stone.”

// 4429
//Harry arranged three pairs of papers side by side. On one pair he wrote ‘magic’
//and ‘magic’. On another pair he wrote ‘magic’ on the top paper only. And the
//third pair he left blank.

// 4430
//“In which case,” Harry said, “either you have two stones or you don’t. Either
//you’re a wizard or not. Powerful wizards would get that way by studying harder
//and practicing more. And if wizards get __inherently__ less powerful, not
//because of spells being lost but because people can’t cast them… then maybe
//they’re eating the wrong foods or something. But if it’s gotten steadily worse
//over eight hundred years, then that could mean magic itself is fading out of
//the world.”

// 4431
//Harry arranged another two pairs of papers side by side, and took out a quill.
//Soon each pair had one piece of paper saying ‘magic’ and the other paper blank.

// 4432
//“And that brings me to the prediction,” said Harry. “What happens when two
//Squibs marry. Flip a coin twice. It can come up heads and heads, heads and
//tails, tails and heads, or tails and tails. So one quarter of the time you’ll
//get two heads, one quarter of the time you’ll get two tails, and half the time
//you’ll get one heads and one tail. Same thing if two Squibs marry. One quarter
//of the children would come up magic and magic, and be wizards. One quarter
//would come up not-magic and not-magic, and be Muggles. The other half would be
//Squibs. It’s a very old and very classic pattern. It was discovered by Gregor
//Mendel who is not forgotten, and it was the first hint ever uncovered for how
//the recipe worked. Anyone who knows anything about blood science would
//recognize that pattern in an instant. It wouldn’t be exact, any more than if
//you flip a coin twice forty times you’ll always get exactly ten pairs of two
//heads. But if it’s seven or thirteen wizards out of forty children that’ll be a
//strong indicator. That’s the test I had you do. Now let’s see your data.”

// 4433
//And before Draco could even think, Harry Potter had taken the parchment out of
//Draco’s hand.

// 4434
//Draco’s throat was very dry.

// 4435
//Twenty-eight children.

// 4436
//He wasn’t sure of the exact number but he was pretty sure around a fourth had
//been wizards.

// 4437
//“Six wizards out of twenty-eight children,” Harry Potter said after a moment.
//“Well, that’s that, then. And first-years were casting the same spells at the
//same power level eight centuries ago, too. Your test and my test both came out
//the same way.”

// 4438
//There was a long silence in the classroom.

// 4439
//“What now?” Draco whispered.

// 4440
//He’d never been so terrified.

// 4441
//“It’s not definite yet,” said Harry Potter. “My experiment failed, remember? I
//need you to design another test, Draco.”

// 4442
//“I, I…” Draco said. His voice was breaking. “I can’t do this Harry, it’s too
//much for me.”

// 4443
//Harry’s look was fierce. “Yes you can, because you have to. I thought about it
//myself, too, after I found out about the Interdict of Merlin. Draco, is there
//any way of observing the strength of magic directly? Some way that doesn’t have
//anything to do with wizards’ blood or the spells we learn?”

// 4444
//Draco’s mind was just blank.

// 4445
//“Anything that affects magic affects wizards,” said Harry. “But then we can’t
//tell if it’s the wizards or the magic. What does magic affect that
//__isn’t__ a wizard?”

// 4446
//“Magical creatures, obviously,” said Draco without even thinking about it.

// 4447
//Harry Potter slowly smiled. “Draco, that’s __brilliant.__”

// 4448
//__It’s the sort of dumb question you’d only ask in the first place if
//you’d been raised by Muggles.__

// 4449
//Then the sickness in Draco’s stomach got even worse as he realized what it
//would mean if magical creatures __were__ getting weaker. They would know
//for certain then that magic was fading, and there was a part of Draco that was
//already sure that was exactly what they would find. He didn’t want to see this,
//he didn’t want to know…

// 4450
//Harry Potter was already halfway to the door. “Come __on__, Draco! There’s
//a portrait not far from here, we’ll just ask them to go get someone old and
//find out right away! We’re cloaked, if someone sees us we can just run away!
//Let’s go!”

// 4451
//It didn’t take long after that.

// 4452
//It was a wide portrait, but the three people in it were looking rather crowded.
//There was a middle-aged man from the twelfth century, dressed in black swathes
//of cloth; who spoke to a sad-looking young woman from the fourteenth century,
//with hair that seemed to constantly frizz about her head as if she’d been
//charged up by a static spell; and she spoke to a dignified, wizened old man
//from the seventeenth century with a solid gold bowtie; and him they could
//understand.

// 4453
//They had asked about Dementors.

// 4454
//They had asked about phoenixes.

// 4455
//They had asked about dragons and trolls and house elves.

// 4456
//Harry had frowned, pointed out that creatures which needed the most magic could
//just be dying out entirely, and had asked for the most powerful magical
//creatures known.

// 4457
//There wasn’t anything unfamiliar on the list, except for a species of Dark
//creature called mind flayers which the translator noted had finally been
//exterminated by Harold Shea, and those didn’t sound half as scary as Dementors.

// 4458
//Magical creatures were as powerful now as they’d ever been, apparently.

// 4459
//The sickness in Draco’s stomach was easing, and now he just felt confused.

// 4460
//“Harry,” Draco said in the middle of the old man translating a list of all
//eleven powers of a beholder’s eyes, “what does this mean?”

// 4461
//Harry held up a finger and the old man finished the list.

// 4462
//Then Harry thanked all the portraits for helping - Draco, pretty much on
//automatic, did so as well and more graciously - and they headed back to the
//classroom.

// 4463
//And Harry brought out the original parchment with the hypotheses, and began
//scribbling.

// 4464
//__Observation:__

// 4465
//__Wizardry isn’t as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was founded.__

// 4466
//__Hypotheses:__

// 4467
//__1____. Magic itself is fading.__

// 4468
//__2____. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.__

// 4469
//__3____. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.__

// 4470
//__4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something else
//besides blood is making them grow up weaker.__

// 4471
//__5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years ago?)__

// 4472
//__6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?
//Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had any
//children.)__

// 4473
//__Tests:__

// 4474
//__A. Are there spells we know but can’t cast (1 or 2) or are the lost
//spells no longer known (3)? Result: Inconclusive due to Interdict of Merlin. No
//known uncastable spell, but could simply have not been passed on.__

// 4475
//__B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of spells, with
//the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2, but blood could also be
//losing powerful wizardry only.) Result: Same level of first-year spells then as
//now.__

// 4476
//__C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using scientific
//knowledge of blood, will explain later. Result: There’s only one place in the
//recipe that makes you a wizard, and either you have two papers saying ‘magic’
//or you don’t.__

// 4477
//__D. Are magical creatures losing their powers? Distinguishes 1 from (2
//or 3). Result: Magical creatures seem to be as strong as they ever were.__

// 4478
//“A failed,” said Harry Potter. “B is weak evidence for 1 over 2. C falsifies 2.
//D falsifies 1. 4 was unlikely and B argues against 4 as well. 5 was unlikely
//and D argues against it. 6 is falsified along with 2. That leaves 3. Interdict
//of Merlin or not, I didn’t actually find any known spell that couldn’t be cast.
//So when you add it all up, it looks like knowledge is being lost.”

// 4479
//And the trap snapped shut.

// 4480
//As soon as the panic went away, as soon as Draco understood that magic
//__wasn’t__ fading out, it took all of five seconds to realize.

// 4481
//Draco shoved himself away from the desk and stood up so hard that his chair
//skittered with a scraping noise across the floor and fell over.

// 4482
//“So it was all just a stupid trick, then.”

// 4483
//Harry Potter stared at him for a moment, still sitting. When he spoke, his
//voice was quiet. “It was a fair test, Draco. If it had come out a different
//way, I would have accepted it. That’s not something I would ever cheat on.
//Ever. I didn’t look at your data before I made my predictions. I told you up
//front when the Interdict of Merlin invalidated the first experiment -”

// 4484
//“Oh,” Draco said, the anger starting to come out into his voice, “you didn’t
//know how the whole thing was going to come out?”

// 4485
//“I didn’t __know__ anything you didn’t know,” Harry said, still quietly.
//“I admit that I suspected. Hermione Granger was too powerful, she should have
//been barely magical and she wasn’t, how can a Muggleborn be the best
//spellcaster in Hogwarts? And she’s getting the best grades on her essays too,
//it’s too much coincidence for one girl to be the strongest magically
//__and__ academically unless there’s a single cause. Hermione Granger’s
//existence pointed to there being only one thing that makes you a wizard,
//something you either have or you don’t, and the power differences coming from
//how much we know and how much we practice. And there weren’t different classes
//for purebloods and Muggleborns, and so on. There were too many ways the world
//didn’t look the way it would look if you were right. But Draco, I didn’t see
//anything you couldn’t see too. I didn’t perform any tests I didn’t tell you
//about. I didn’t cheat, Draco. I wanted us to work out the answer together. And
//I never thought that magic might be fading out of the world until you said it.
//It was a scary idea for me, too.”

// 4486
//“Whatever,” Draco said. He was working very hard to control his voice and not
//just start screaming at Harry. “You claim you’re not going to run off and tell
//anyone else about this.”

// 4487
//“Not without consulting you first,” Harry said. He opened his hands in a
//pleading gesture. “Draco, I’m being as nice as I can but __the world
//turned out to just not be that way__.”

// 4488
//“Fine. Then you and I are through. I’m going to just walk away and forget any
//of this ever happened.”

// 4489
//Draco spun around, feeling the burning sensation in his throat, the sense of
//betrayal, and that was when he realized he really __had__ liked Harry
//Potter, and that thought didn’t slow him down for a moment as he strode toward
//the classroom door.

// 4490
//And Harry Potter’s voice came, now louder, and worried:

// 4491
//“Draco… you __can’t__ forget. Don’t you understand? That was your
//sacrifice.”

// 4492
//Draco stopped in midstride and turned around. “__What__ are you talking
//about?”

// 4493
//But there was already a freezing coldness in Draco’s spine.

// 4494
//He knew even before Harry Potter said it.

// 4495
//“To become a scientist. You questioned one of your beliefs, not just a small
//belief but something that had great significance to you. You did experiments,
//gathered data, and the outcome proved the belief was wrong. You saw the results
//and understood what they meant.” Harry Potter’s voice was faltering. “Remember,
//Draco, you can’t sacrifice a __true__ belief that way, because the
//experiments will confirm it instead of falsifying it. Your sacrifice to become
//a scientist was your __false__ belief that wizard blood was mixing and
//getting weaker.”

// 4496
//“__That’s not true!__” said Draco. “I didn’t sacrifice the belief. I still
//believe that!” His voice was getting louder, and the chill was getting worse.

// 4497
//Harry Potter shook his head. His voice came in a whisper. “Draco… I’m sorry,
//Draco, you __don’t__ believe it, not anymore.” Harry’s voice rose again.
//“I’ll prove it to you. Imagine that someone tells you they’re keeping a dragon
//in their house. You tell them you want to see it. They say it’s an invisible
//dragon. You say fine, you’ll listen to it move. They say it’s an inaudible
//dragon. You say you’ll throw some cooking flour into the air and see the
//outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable to flour. And the
//telling thing is that they know, in __advance,__ exactly which
//experimental results they’ll have to explain away. They __know__
//everything will come out the way it does if there’s no dragon, they know in
//__advance__ just which excuses they’ll have to make. So maybe they
//__say__ there’s a dragon. Maybe they __believe__ they believe there’s
//a dragon, it’s called belief-in-belief. But they don’t actually believe it. You
//can be mistaken about what you believe, most people never realize there’s a
//difference between believing something and thinking it’s good to believe it.”
//Harry Potter had risen from the desk now, and taken a few steps toward Draco.
//“And Draco, you don’t believe any more in blood purism, I’ll show you that you
//don’t. If blood purism is true, then Hermione Granger doesn’t make sense, so
//what could explain her? Maybe she’s a wizarding orphan raised by Muggles, just
//like I was? I could go to Granger and ask to see pictures of her parents, to
//see if she looks like them. Would you expect her to look different? Should we
//go perform that test?”

// 4498
//“They would have put her with relatives,” Draco said, his voice trembling.
//“They’ll still look the same.”

// 4499
//“You see. You already know what experimental result you’ll have to excuse. If
//you still believed in blood purism you would say, sure, let’s go take a look, I
//bet she won’t look like her parents, she’s too powerful to be a real Muggleborn
//-”

// 4500
//“They __would__ have put her with relatives!”

// 4501
//“Scientists can do tests to check for sure if someone is the true child of a
//father. Granger would probably do it if I paid her family enough. __She__
//wouldn’t be afraid of the results. So what do you expect that test to show?
//Tell me to run it and we will. But you already know what the test will say.
//You’ll always know. You won’t ever be able to forget. You might __wish__
//you believed in blood purism, but you’ll always __expect to see happen__
//just exactly what would happen if there was only one thing that made you a
//wizard. That was your sacrifice to become a scientist.”

// 4502
//Draco’s breathing was ragged. “Do you realize __what you’ve done?__” Draco
//surged forward and he seized Harry by the collar of his robes. His voice rose
//to a scream, it sounded unbearably loud in the closed classroom and the
//silence. ”__Do you realize what you’ve done?__”

// 4503
//Harry’s voice was shaky. “You had a belief. The belief was false. I helped you
//see that. What’s true is already so, owning up to it doesn’t make it worse -”

// 4504
//The fingers on Draco’s right hand clenched into a fist and that hand dropped
//down and blasted up unstoppably and punched Harry Potter in the jaw so hard
//that his body went crashing back into a desk and then to the floor.

// 4505
//“__Idiot!__” screamed Draco. ”__Idiot! Idiot!__”

// 4506
//“Draco,” whispered Harry from the floor, “Draco, I’m sorry, I didn’t think this
//would happen for months, I didn’t expect you to awaken as a scientist this
//quickly, I thought I would have longer to prepare you, teach you the techniques
//that make it hurt less to admit you’re wrong -”

// 4507
//“What about Father?” Draco said. His voice trembled with rage. “Were you going
//to prepare __him__ or did you just not __care__ what happened after
//this?”

// 4508
//“You can’t tell __him!__” Harry said, his voice rising in alarm. “He’s not
//a scientist! You promised, Draco!”

// 4509
//For a moment the thought of Father not knowing came as a relief.

// 4510
//And then the real anger started to rise.

// 4511
//“So you planned for me to lie to him and tell him I still believe,” Draco said,
//voice shaking. “I’ll always have to lie to him, and now when I grow up I can’t
//be a Death Eater, and I won’t even be able to tell him why not.”

// 4512
//“If your father really loves you,” whispered Harry from the floor, “he’ll still
//love you even if you don’t become a Death Eater, and it sounds like your father
//__does__ really love you, Draco -”

// 4513
//“__Your__ stepfather is a scientist,” Draco said. The words coming out
//like biting knives. “If __you__ weren’t going to be a scientist, he would
//still love you. But you’d be a __little less special__ to him.”

// 4514
//Harry flinched. The boy opened his mouth, as if to say ‘I’m sorry’, and then
//closed his mouth, seeming to think better of it, which was either very smart of
//him or very lucky, because Draco might have tried to kill him.

// 4515
//“You should have warned me,” Draco said. His voice rose. “__You should
//have warned me!__”

// 4516
//“I… I did… every time I told you about the power, I told you about the price. I
//said, you have to admit you’re wrong. I said this would be the hardest path for
//you. That this was the sacrifice anyone had to make to become a scientist. I
//said, what if the experiment says one thing and your family and friends say
//another -”

// 4517
//“__You call that a warning?__” Draco was screaming now. ”__You call
//that a warning? When we’re doing a ritual that calls for a permanent
//sacrifice?__”

// 4518
//“I… I…” The boy on the floor swallowed. “I guess maybe it wasn’t clear. I’m
//sorry. But that which can be destroyed by the truth should be.”
// копія 20:3638

// 4519
//Hitting him wasn’t enough.

// 4520
//“You’re wrong about one thing,” Draco said, his voice deadly. “Granger isn’t
//the strongest student in Hogwarts. She just gets the best grades in class.
//You’re about to find out the difference.”

// 4521
//Sudden shock showed in Harry’s face, and he tried to roll quickly to his feet -

// 4522
//It was already too late for him.

// 4523
//“__Expelliarmus!__”

// 4524
//Harry’s wand flew across the room.

// 4525
//“__Gom jabbar!__”

// 4526
//A pulse of inky blackness struck Harry’s left hand.

// 4527
//“That’s a torture spell,” said Draco. “It’s for getting information out of
//people. I’m just going to leave it on you and lock the door behind me when I
//go. Maybe I’ll set the locking spell to wear off after a few hours. Maybe it
//won’t wear off until you die in here. Have fun.”

// 4528
//Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still on Harry. Draco’s hand dipped down,
//picked up his bookbag, without his aim wavering.

// 4529
//The pain was already showing in Harry Potter’s face as he spoke. “Malfoys are
//above the underage magic laws, I take it? It’s not because your blood is
//stronger. It’s because you already practiced. In the beginning you were as weak
//as any of us. Is my prediction wrong?”

// 4530
//Draco’s hand whitened on his wand, but his aim stayed steady.

// 4531
//“Just so you know,” Harry said through gritted teeth, “if you’d told me I was
//wrong I would have listened. __I__ won’t ever torture __you__ when
//you show me that I’m wrong. And you __will__. Someday. You’re awakened as
//a scientist now, and even if you never learn to use your power, you’ll always,”
//Harry gasped, “be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs -”

// 4532
//Draco’s backing away was less smooth, now, a little faster, and he had to work
//to keep his wand on Harry as he reached back to open the door and stepped back
//out of the classroom.

// 4533
//Then Draco shut the door again.

// 4534
//He cast the most powerful locking Charm he knew.

// 4535
//Draco waited until he heard Harry’s first scream before casting the
//__Quietus.__

// 4536
//And then he walked away.

// 4537
//“__Aaahhhhh! Finite Incantatem! Aaaahhh!__”

// 4538
//Harry’s left hand had been put into a pot of boiling cooking oil and left
//there. He’d put everything he had into the __Finite Incantatem__ and it
//still wasn’t working.

// 4539
//Some hexes required specific counters or you couldn’t undo them, or maybe it
//was just that Draco was that much stronger.

// 4540
//“__Aaaaahhhh!__”

// 4541
//Harry’s hand was really starting to hurt, now, and that was interfering with
//his attempts to think creatively.

// 4542
//But a few screams later, Harry realized what he had to do.

// 4543
//His pouch, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of his body, and it took some
//twisting to reach into it, especially with his other arm flailing around in a
//reflex, unstoppable attempt to fling off the source of pain. By the time he
//managed it his other arm had managed to throw away his wand again.

// 4544
//“Medical __ahhhhh__ kit! Medical kit!”

// 4545
//On the floor, the green light was too dim to see by.

// 4546
//Harry couldn’t stand. He couldn’t crawl. He rolled across the floor to where he
//thought his wand was, and it wasn’t there, and with one hand he managed to
//raise himself high enough to see his wand, and he rolled there, and got the
//wand, and rolled back to where the medical kit was opened. There was also a
//good deal of screaming, and a bit of throwing up.

// 4547
//It took eight tries before Harry could cast __Lumos.__

// 4548
//And then, well, the package wasn’t designed to be opened one-handed, because
//all wizards were idiots, that was why. Harry had to use his teeth and so it
//took a while before Harry finally managed to wrap the Numbcloth over his left
//hand.

// 4549
//When all feeling in his left hand was finally gone, Harry let his mind come
//apart, and lay motionless on the floor, and cried for a while.

// 4550
//__Well,__ Harry’s mind said silently into itself, when it had recovered
//enough to think in words again. __Was it worth it?__

// 4551
//Slowly, Harry’s functional hand reached up to a desk.

// 4552
//Harry pulled himself to his feet.

// 4553
//Took a deep breath.

// 4554
//Exhaled.

// 4555
//Smiled.

// 4556
//It wasn’t much of a smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.

// 4557
//__Thank you, Professor Quirrell, I couldn’t have lost without you.__

// 4558
//He hadn’t redeemed Draco yet, not even close. Contrary to what Draco himself
//might now believe, Draco was still the child of a Death Eater, through and
//through. Still a boy who’d grown up thinking “rape” was something the cool
//older kids did. But it was one heck of a start.

// 4559
//Harry couldn’t claim it had all gone just as planned. It had all gone just as
//completely made up on the spot. The __plan__ hadn’t called for this to
//happen until December or thereabouts, after Harry had taught Draco the
//techniques not to deny the evidence when he saw it.

// 4560
//But he’d seen the look of fear on Draco’s face, realized that Draco was
//__already__ taking an alternative hypothesis seriously, and seized the
//moment. One case of true curiosity had the same sort of redeeming power in
//rationality that one case of true love had in movies.

// 4561
//In retrospect, Harry had given himself hours to make the most important
//discovery in the history of magic, and months to break through the undeveloped
//mental barriers of an eleven-year-old boy. This could indicate that Harry had
//some sort of major cognitive deficit with respect to estimating task completion
//times.

// 4562
//Was Harry going to Science Hell for what he’d done? Harry wasn’t sure. He’d
//contrived to keep Draco’s mind on the possibility that magic was fading, made
//sure Draco would carry out the part of the experiment that would seem at first
//to point in that direction. He’d waited until after explaining genetics to
//prompt Draco into realizing about magical creatures (though Harry had thought
//in terms of ancient artifacts like the Sorting Hat, which no one could
//duplicate anymore, but which continued to function). But Harry hadn’t actually
//exaggerated any evidence, hadn’t distorted the meaning of any results. When the
//Interdict of Merlin had invalidated the test that should have been definitive,
//he’d told Draco up front.

// 4563
//And then there was the part __after__ that…

// 4564
//But he hadn’t actually __lied__ to Draco. Draco had believed it, and
//__that would make it true.__

// 4565
//The end, admittedly, had not been fun.

// 4566
//Harry turned, and staggered toward the door.

// 4567
//Time to test Draco’s locking spell.

// 4568
//The first step was simply trying to turn the doorknob. Draco could have been
//bluffing.

// 4569
//Draco hadn’t been bluffing.

// 4570
//“__Finite Incantatem.__” Harry’s voice came out rather hoarse, and he
//could feel that the spell hadn’t taken.

// 4571
//So Harry tried it again, and that time it felt true. But another twist at the
//doorknob showed it hadn’t worked. No surprise there.

// 4572
//Time to bring out the big guns. Harry drew a deep breath. This spell was one of
//the most powerful he’d learned so far.

// 4573
//“__Alohomora!__”

// 4574
//Harry staggered a little after saying it.

// 4575
//And the classroom door still didn’t open.

// 4576
//That shocked Harry. Harry hadn’t been planning to go anywhere near Dumbledore’s
//forbidden corridor, of course. But a spell to open magical locks had seemed
//like a useful sort of spell anyway, and so Harry had learned it. Was
//Dumbledore’s forbidden corridor meant to lure people so stupid that they didn’t
//notice the security was worse than what Draco Malfoy could put on it?

// 4577
//Fear was creeping back into Harry’s system. The placard in the medical kit had
//said the Numbcloth could only safely be used for up to thirty minutes. After
//that it would come off automatically, and not be reusable for 24 hours. Right
//now it was 6:51pm. He’d put on the Numbcloth about five minutes ago.

// 4578
//So Harry took a step back, and considered the door. It was a solid panel of
//dark oaken wood, interrupted only by the brass metal doorknob.

// 4579
//Harry didn’t know any explosive or cutting or smashing spells, and
//Transfiguring explosive would have violated the rule against Transfiguring
//things to be burned. Acid was a liquid and would have made fumes…

// 4580
//But that was no obstacle to a __creative thinker.__

// 4581
//Harry laid his wand against one of the door’s brass hinges, and concentrated on
//the form of cotton as a pure abstraction apart from any material cotton, and
//also on the pure material apart from the pattern that made it a brass hinge,
//and brought the two concepts together, imposing shape on substance. An hour of
//Transfiguration practice every day for a month had gotten Harry to the point
//where he could Transfigure a subject of five cubic centimeters in just under a
//minute.

// 4582
//After two minutes the hinge hadn’t changed at all.

// 4583
//Whoever had designed Draco’s locking spell, they’d thought of that, too. Or the
//door was part of Hogwarts and the castle was immune.

// 4584
//A glance showed the walls to be solid stone. So was the floor. So was the
//ceiling. You couldn’t separately Transfigure a part of something that was a
//solid whole; Harry would have needed to try Transfiguring the whole wall, which
//would have taken hours or maybe days of continuous effort, if he could have
//done it at all, and if the wall wasn’t contiguous with the rest of the whole
//castle…

// 4585
//Harry’s Time-Turner wouldn’t open until 9pm. After that he could go back to
//6pm, before the door was locked.

// 4586
//How long would the torture spell last?

// 4587
//Harry swallowed hard. Tears were coming into his eyes again.

// 4588
//His brilliantly creative mind had just offered the ingenious suggestion that
//Harry could cut his hand off using the hacksaw in the toolset stored in his
//pouch, which would hurt, obviously, but might hurt a lot less than Draco’s pain
//spell, since the nerves would be gone; and he had tourniquets in the healer’s
//kit.

// 4589
//And that was obviously a hideously stupid idea that Harry would regret the rest
//of his entire life.

// 4590
//But Harry didn’t know if he could hold out for two hours under torture.

// 4591
//He wanted __out__ of this classroom, he wanted out of this classroom
//__now,__ he didn’t want to wait in here screaming for two hours until he
//could use the Time-Turner, he needed to __get out__ and find someone to
//get the torture spell off his hand…

// 4592
//__Think!__ Harry screamed at his brain. __Think! Think!__

// 4593
//The Slytherin dorm was mostly empty. People were at dinner. For some reason
//Draco himself wasn’t feeling very hungry.

// 4594
//Draco closed the door to his private room, locked it, Charmed it shut, Quieted
//it, sat down on his bed, and started to cry.

// 4595
//It wasn’t fair.

// 4596
//It wasn’t fair.

// 4597
//It was the first time Draco had ever really __lost__ before, Father had
//warned him that losing for real would hurt the first time it happened, but he’d
//lost __so much__, it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t fair for him to lose
//__everything__ the very first time he lost.

// 4598
//Somewhere in the dungeons, a boy Draco had actually liked was screaming in
//pain. Draco had never hurt anyone he’d liked before. Punishing people who
//deserved it was supposed to be fun, but this just felt sick inside. Father
//hadn’t warned him about that, and Draco wondered if it was a hard lesson
//everyone had to learn when they grew up, or if Draco was just weak.

// 4599
//Draco wished it were Pansy screaming. That would have felt better.

// 4600
//And the worst part was knowing that it might have been a mistake to hurt Harry
//Potter.

// 4601
//Who else was there for Draco now? Dumbledore? After what he’d done? Draco would
//sooner have been burned alive.

// 4602
//Draco would have to go back to Harry Potter because there was nowhere else for
//him to go. And if Harry Potter said he didn’t want him, then Draco would be
//nothing, just a pathetic little boy who could never be a Death Eater, never
//join Dumbledore’s faction, never learn science.

// 4603
//The trap had been perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father had warned Draco
//over and over that what you sacrificed to Dark rituals couldn’t be regained.
//But Father hadn’t known that the accursed Muggles had invented rituals that
//didn’t need wands, rituals you could be tricked into doing without knowing it,
//and that was only one of the terrible secrets which scientists knew and which
//Harry Potter had brought with him.

// 4604
//Draco started crying harder, then.

// 4605
//He didn’t want this, he __didn’t want this__ but there was no turning
//back. It was too late. He was already a scientist.

// 4606
//Draco knew he should go back and free Harry Potter and apologize. It would have
//been the smart thing to do.

// 4607
//Instead Draco stayed in his bed and sobbed.

// 4608
//He’d already hurt Harry Potter. It might be the only time Draco ever got to
//hurt him, and he would have to hold to that one memory for the rest of his
//life.

// 4609
//Let him keep screaming.

// 4610
//Harry dropped the remnants of his hacksaw to the ground. The brass hinges had
//proved impervious, not even scratched, and Harry was beginning to suspect that
//even the desperation act of trying to Transfigure acid or explosives would have
//failed to open this door. On the plus side, the attempt had destroyed the
//hacksaw.

// 4611
//His watch said it was 7:02pm, with less than fifteen minutes left, and Harry
//tried to remember if there were any other sharp things in his pouch that needed
//destroying, and felt another fit of tears welling up. If only, when his
//Time-Turner opened, he could go back and __prevent__ -

// 4612
//And that was when Harry realized he was being __silly__.

// 4613
//It wasn’t the first time he’d been locked in a room.

// 4614
//Professor McGonagall had already told him the correct way to do this.

// 4615
//…she’d also told him not to use the Time-Turner for this sort of thing.

// 4616
//Would Professor McGonagall realize that this occasion really __did__
//warrant a special exception? Or just take away the Time-Turner entirely?

// 4617
//Harry gathered up all his things, all the evidence, into his pouch. A
//__Scourgify__ took care of the vomit on the floor, though not the sweat
//that had soaked his robes. He left the overturned desks overturned, it wasn’t
//important enough to be worth doing with one hand.

// 4618
//When he was done, Harry glanced down at his watch. 7:04pm.

// 4619
//And then Harry waited. Seconds passed, feeling like years.

// 4620
//At 7:07pm, the door opened.

// 4621
//Professor Flitwick’s puff-bearded face looked rather concerned. “Are you all
//right, Harry?” said the squeaky voice of Ravenclaw’s Head of House. “I got a
//note saying you’d been locked in here -”
