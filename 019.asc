//== Delayed Gratification

// 3346
//Blood for the blood god! Skulls for J. K. Rowling!

// 3347
//Draco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmed robes somehow
//looked far more formal, serious, and well-turned-out than the same exact robes
//as worn by the two boys behind him.

// 3348
//“Talk,” said Draco.

// 3349
//“Yeah! Talk!”

// 3350
//“You heard da boss! Talk!”

// 3351
//“You two, on the other hand, __shut up.__”

// 3352
//The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in that vast
//auditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er, Battle Magic.

// 3353
//The last session of classes on Friday.

// 3354
//Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and that the brilliant
//Professor Quirrell would realize this was perhaps not the best time to single
//out Harry for anything. Harry had recovered a little, but…

// 3355
//…but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of stress relief first.

// 3356
//Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great solemnity upon
//Draco and his minions.

// 3357
//“You ask, what is our aim?” Harry declaimed. “I can answer in one word. It is
//victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of all terrors - Victory,
//however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no -”

// 3358
//“__Talk about Snape,__” Draco hissed. ”__What did you do?__”

// 3359
//Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more serious look.

// 3360
//“You saw it,” Harry said. “Everyone saw it. I snapped my fingers.”

// 3361
//“__Harry! Stop teasing me!__”

// 3362
//So he’d been promoted to __Harry__ now. Interesting. And in fact Harry was
//fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and feel bad if he didn’t respond
//somehow…

// 3363
//Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the minions.

// 3364
//“They won’t talk,” said Draco.

// 3365
//“Draco,” Harry said, “I’m going to be one hundred percent honest here and say
//that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with Mr. Goyle’s cunning.”

// 3366
//Mr. Goyle winced.

// 3367
//“Me neither,” said Draco. “I explained to him that I ended up owing you a favor
//because of it.” (Mr. Goyle winced again.) “But there __is__ a big
//difference between that sort of mistake and being indiscreet. That really is
//something they’ve been trained from childhood to understand.”

// 3368
//“All right then,” Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though the background
//noises had gone to blurs in Draco’s presence. “I deduced one of Severus’s
//secrets and did a bit of blackmail.”

// 3369
//Draco’s expression hardened. “Good, now tell me something you didn’t tell in
//strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor, meaning that was the story you
//__wanted__ to get all over the school.”

// 3370
//Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught it.

// 3371
//“What is Severus saying?” Harry said.

// 3372
//“That he hadn’t realized how sensitive the feelings of young children were,”
//Draco said. “Even in Slytherin! Even to __me!__”

// 3373
//“Are you sure,” Harry said, “that you want to know something your Head of House
//would rather you not know?”

// 3374
//“Yes,” Draco said without hesitation.

// 3375
//__Interesting.__ “Then you really are going to send your minions away
//first, because I’m not sure I can believe everything you believe about them.”

// 3376
//Draco nodded. “Okay.”

// 3377
//Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked __very__ unhappy. “Boss -” said Mr.
//Crabbe.

// 3378
//“You’ve given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you,” Draco said. “Go!”

// 3379
//They left.

// 3380
//“In particular,” Harry said, lowering his voice even further, “I’m not
//__entirely__ sure that they wouldn’t just report what I said to Lucius.”

// 3381
//“Father wouldn’t __do__ that!” Draco said, looking genuinely aghast.
//“They’re __mine!__”

// 3382
//“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said. “I’m just not sure I can believe everything you
//believe about your father. Imagine it was your secret and me telling you my
//father wouldn’t do that.”

// 3383
//Draco nodded slowly. “You’re right. __I’m__ sorry, Harry. It was wrong of
//me to ask it of you.”

// 3384
//__How did I get __this__ promoted? Shouldn’t he hate me now? __Harry
//had the feeling he was looking at something exploitable… he just wished his
//brain wasn’t so exhausted. Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand at
//some complicated plotting.

// 3385
//“Anyway,” Harry said. “Trade. I tell you a fact that isn’t on the grapevine,
//and does not __go__ on the grapevine, and in __particular__ does not
//go to your father, and in return you tell me what you and Slytherin think about
//the whole business.”

// 3386
//“Deal!”

// 3387
//Now to make this as vague as possible… something that wouldn’t hurt much even
//if it did get out… “What I said was true. I did discover one of Severus’s
//secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But Severus wasn’t the only person
//involved.”

// 3388
//“__I knew it!__” Draco said exultantly.

// 3389
//Harry’s stomach sank. He had apparently said something very significant and he
//did not know why. This was not a good sign.

// 3390
//“All right,” Draco said. He was grinning widely now. “So here’s what the
//reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were like, ‘We hate Harry
//Potter! Let’s go beat him up!’”

// 3391
//Harry choked. “What is __wrong__ with the Sorting Hat? That’s not
//Slytherin, it’s __Gryffindor__ -”

// 3392
//“Not all children are prodigies,” Draco said, though he was smiling in a sort
//of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest that he privately agreed with
//Harry’s opinion. “And it took around fifteen seconds for someone to explain to
//them why this might not be such a favor to Snape, so you’re fine. Anyway, after
//that was the second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, ‘Looks like Harry
//Potter was just another do-gooder after all.’”

// 3393
//“And then?” Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why __that__
//was stupid.

// 3394
//“And then the actual smart people started talking. It’s obvious that you found
//a way to put a __lot__ of pressure on Snape. And while that could be more
//than one thing… the obvious __next__ thought is that it has something to
//do with Snape’s unknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?”

// 3395
//“No comment,” Harry said. At least his brain was processing this part
//correctly. House Slytherin __had__ wondered why Severus wasn’t getting
//fired. And they’d concluded that Severus was blackmailing Dumbledore. Could
//that actually be true…? But Dumbledore hadn’t seemed to act like it…

// 3396
//Draco went on talking. “And the __next__ thing the smart people pointed
//out was that if you could put enough pressure on Snape to make him leave half
//of Hogwarts alone, that meant you probably had enough power to get rid of him
//entirely, if you wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same
//way he tried to humiliate you - but you left us our Head of House.”

// 3397
//Harry made his smile wider.

// 3398
//“And then the __really__ smart people,” Draco said, his face now serious,
//“went off and had a little discussion by themselves, and someone pointed out
//that it would be a very stupid thing to leave an enemy around like that. If you
//could break his hold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it.
//Dumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him killed,
//he’d be __very__ grateful to you, and you wouldn’t have to worry about
//Snape sneaking into your dorm room at night with interesting potions.”

// 3399
//Harry’s face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he really, really
//should have. “And from this you concluded…?”

// 3400
//“Snape’s hold was some secret of Dumbledore’s and __you’ve got the
//secret!__” Draco was looking exultant. “It can’t be powerful enough to destroy
//Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have used it by now. Snape refuses to use
//his hold for anything except staying king of Slytherin House in Hogwarts, and
//he doesn’t always get what he wants even then, so it must have limits. But it’s
//__got__ to be really good! Father’s been trying to get Snape to tell him
//for __years!__”

// 3401
//“And,” Harry said, “now Lucius thinks maybe __I__ can tell him. Did you
//already get an owl -”

// 3402
//“I will tonight,” Draco said, and laughed. “It will say,” his voice took on a
//different, more formal cadence, “__My beloved son: I’ve already told you
//of Harry Potter’s potential importance. As you have already realized, his
//importance has now become greater and more urgent. If you see any possible
//avenue of friendship or point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the
//full resources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.__”

// 3403
//Gosh. “Well,” Harry said, “not commenting on whether or not your whole
//complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that we are not quite
//such good friends as yet.”

// 3404
//“I know,” Draco said. Then his face turned __very__ serious, and his voice
//grew quiet even within the blur. “Harry, has it occurred to you that if you
//know something Dumbledore doesn’t want known, Dumbledore might simply have you
//killed? And it would turn the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader
//into a valuable martyr, too.”

// 3405
//“No comment,” Harry said yet again. He hadn’t thought of that last part,
//either. Didn’t __seem__ to be Dumbledore’s style… but…

// 3406
//“Harry,” Draco said, “you’ve obviously got __incredible __talent, but
//you’ve got no training and no mentors and you do stupid things sometimes and
//__you really need an advisor who knows how to do this or you’re going to
//get hurt!__” Draco’s face was fierce.

// 3407
//“Ah,” Harry said. “An advisor like Lucius?”

// 3408
//“Like __me!__” said Draco. “I’ll promise to keep your secrets from Father,
//from __everyone,__ I’ll just help you figure out whatever you want to do!”

// 3409
//Wow.

// 3410
//Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the doors.

// 3411
//“Class is about to start,” said Harry. “I’ll think about what you said, there’s
//lots of times I __do__ wish I had all your training, it’s just I don’t
//know how I can trust you so quickly -”

// 3412
//“You shouldn’t,” Draco said, “it’s too soon. See? I’ll give you good advice
//even if it hurts me. But we should maybe __hurry up__ and become closer
//friends.”

// 3413
//“I’m open to that,” said Harry, who was already trying to figure out how to
//exploit it.

// 3414
//“Another bit of advice,” Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell slouched toward his
//desk, “right now everyone in Slytherin’s wondering about you, so if you’re
//courting us, which I think you are, you should do something that signals
//friendship to Slytherin. __Soon__, like today or tomorrow.”

// 3415
//“Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin wasn’t enough?”
//No reason Harry couldn’t take credit for it.

// 3416
//Draco’s eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly, “It’s not the
//same, trust me, it’s got to be something obvious. Push your mudblood rival
//Granger into a wall or something, everyone in Slytherin will know what that
//means -”

// 3417
//“That is __not__ how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you have to push
//someone into a wall it means your brain is too __weak__ to beat them the
//right way and everyone in Ravenclaw __knows that__ -”

// 3418
//The screen on Harry’s desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash of nostalgia
//for television and computers.

// 3419
//“Ahem,” said Professor Quirrell’s voice, seeming to speak personally to Harry
//out of the screen. “Please take your seats.”

// 3420
//And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater screens on their
//desks, or looking down directly at the great white marble stage where Professor
//Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk atop the small dais of darker marble.

// 3421
//“Today,” said Professor Quirrell, “I had planned to teach you your first
//defensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of today’s
//__Protego.__ But on second thought I have changed today’s lesson plan in
//the light of recent events.”

// 3422
//Professor Quirrell’s gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry winced from where
//he was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling he knew who was about to be
//called on.

// 3423
//“Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,” said Professor
//Quirrell.

// 3424
//Whew.

// 3425
//“Yes, Professor?” said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming to come from the
//repeater screen on Harry’s desk, which showed Draco’s face as he spoke. Then
//the screen shifted back to Professor Quirrell, who said:

// 3426
//“Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?”

// 3427
//“That’s an odd question, Professor,” said Draco. “I mean, who’d be dumb enough
//to admit it?”

// 3428
//A few students laughed, but not many.

// 3429
//“Indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. “So while there’s no point in asking any of
//you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if there were a student or two
//in my classes who harbored ambitions of being the next Dark Lord. After all,
//__I__ wanted to be the next Dark Lord when __I__ was a young
//Slytherin.”

// 3430
//This time the laughter was much more widespread.

// 3431
//“Well, it __is__ the House of the ambitious, after all,” Professor
//Quirrell said, smiling. “I didn’t realize until later that what I really
//enjoyed was Battle Magic, and that my true ambition was to become a great
//fighting wizard and someday teach at Hogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteen
//years old, I read through the historical sections of the Hogwarts library,
//scrutinizing the lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a list of all
//the mistakes that __I__ would never make when __I__ was a Dark Lord
//-”

// 3432
//Harry giggled before he could stop himself.

// 3433
//“Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess what was the very
//first item on that list?”

// 3434
//__Great.__ “Um… never use a complicated way of dealing with an enemy when
//you can just Abracadabra them?”

// 3435
//“The __term,__ Mr. Potter, is __Avada Kedavra,__” Professor
//Quirrell’s voice sounded a bit sharp for some reason, “and no, that was
//__not__ on the list I made at age thirteen. Would you care to guess
//again?”

// 3436
//“Ah… never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?”

// 3437
//Professor Quirrell laughed. “Ah, now __that__ was number two. My, Mr.
//Potter, have we been reading the same books?”

// 3438
//There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harry clenched his
//jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would accomplish nothing.

// 3439
//“But no. The __first__ item was, ‘I will not go around provoking strong,
//vicious enemies.’ The history of the world would be very different if
//Mornelithe Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped that elementary point. Now
//__if,__ Mr. Potter - just __if__ by some chance you harbor an
//ambition similar to the one I held as a young Slytherin - even so, I hope it is
//not your ambition to become a __stupid__ Dark Lord.”

// 3440
//“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, gritting his teeth, “I am a
//__Ravenclaw__ and it is not my ambition to be stupid, period. I know that
//what I did today was dumb. But it wasn’t __Dark!__ I was __not__ the
//one who threw the first punch in that fight!”

// 3441
//“You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age. Thus I
//anticipated your answer and altered today’s lesson plan accordingly. Mr.
//Gregory Goyle, if you would come forward, please?”

// 3442
//There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn’t been expecting that.

// 3443
//Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather uncertain and
//worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached the dais.
Так само, якщо судити по виразу обличчя, цього не очікував містер Ґойл. Виглядаючи
невпевнено та схвильовано, він вибрався на мармурову платформу та наблизився до
підвищення.

// 3444
//Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on the desk. He
//looked suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and he drew himself up
//into a clearly recognizable martial arts stance.
Професор Квірел перестав спиратися на стіл та вирівнявся. Раптово, він почав виглядати
сильнішим, а його руки стиснулися в кулаки. Він став у позицію, що, безсумнівно,
була з якогось бойового мистецтва.

// 3445
//Harry’s eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle had been
//called up.
Коли Гаррі побачив, що відбувається, і зрозумів, чому викликали містера Ґойла, у нього
поширшали очі.

// 3446
//“Most wizards,” Professor Quirrell said, “do not bother much with what a Muggle
//would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger than a fist? This attitude is
//stupid. Wands are held in fists. If you want to be a great fighting wizard you
//__must__ learn martial arts to a level which would impress even a Muggle.
//I will now demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I learned
//in a __dojo,__ a Muggle school of martial arts, of which I shall speak
//more shortly. For now…” Professor Quirrell took several steps forward, still in
//stance, advancing on where Mr. Goyle stood. “Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to
//attack me.”

// 3447
//“Professor Quirrell,” said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as the
//professor’s was, “can I ask what level -”

// 3448
//“Sixth __dan__. You will not be hurt and neither will I. And if you see an
//opening, please take it.”

// 3449
//Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.

// 3450
//“Note,” Professor Quirrell said, “that Mr. Goyle was afraid to attack someone
//who did not know martial arts to an acceptable level, for fear that I, or he,
//would be hurt. Mr. Goyle’s attitude is exactly correct and he has earned three
//Quirrell points for it. Now, fight!”

// 3451
//The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor blocked every
//blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle blocked and spun and tried to
//trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and Quirrell hopped over it and it was all
//happening too fast for Harry to make sense of what was going on and then Goyle
//was on his back with his legs pushing and Quirrell was actually __flying
//through the air__ and then he hit the ground shoulder first and rolled.

// 3452
//“Stop!” cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a little panicked.
//“You win!”

// 3453
//Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping and falling from
//the aborted momentum of his headlong charge toward Professor Quirrell. His face
//showed utter shock.

// 3454
//Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using a peculiar
//springing motion that made no use of his hands.

// 3455
//There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total confusion.

// 3456
//“Mr. Goyle,” said Professor Quirrell, “what vitally important technique did I
//demonstrate?”

// 3457
//“How to fall correctly when someone throws you,” said Mr. Goyle. “It’s one of
//the very first lessons you learn -”

// 3458
//“That too,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 3459
//There was a pause.

// 3460
//“The vitally important technique which I demonstrated,” said Professor
//Quirrell, “was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank you.”

// 3461
//Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered. Harry felt the
//same way.

// 3462
//Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning on it.
//“Sometimes we forget the most basic things, since it has been too long since we
//learned them. I realized I had done the same with my own lesson plan. You do
//not teach students to throw until you have taught them to fall. And I must not
//teach you to fight if you do not understand how to lose.”

// 3463
//Professor Quirrell’s face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a hint of pain, a
//touch of sorrow, in those eyes. “I learned how to lose in a __dojo__ in
//Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is where all the good martial artists live.
//This __dojo__ taught a style which had a reputation among fighting wizards
//as adapting well to magical dueling. The Master of that __dojo__ - an old
//man by Muggle standards - was that style’s greatest living teacher. He had no
//idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study there, and was one of
//the few students accepted that year, from among many contenders. There might
//have been a tiny bit of special influence involved.”

// 3464
//There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn’t share it. That hadn’t
//been right at all.

// 3465
//“In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been beaten in a
//particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and attacked my sparring
//partner -”

// 3466
//__Yikes.__

// 3467
//“- thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master, surprisingly,
//did not expel me on the spot. But he told me that there was a flaw in my
//temperament. He explained it to me, and I knew that he was right. And then he
//said that I would learn how to lose.”

// 3468
//Professor Quirrell’s face was expressionless.

// 3469
//“Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the __dojo__ lined up. One
//by one, they approached me. I was __not__ to defend myself. I was only to
//beg for mercy. One by one, they slapped me, or punched me, and pushed me to the
//ground. Some of them spat on me. They called me awful names in their language.
//And to each one, I had to say, ‘I lose!’ and similar such things, such as ‘I
//beg you to stop!’ and ‘I admit you’re better than me!’”

// 3470
//Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was no way something
//like that could have happened to the dignified Professor Quirrell.

// 3471
//“I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic alone I could
//have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I learned to lose. To this
//day I remember it as one of the most unpleasant hours of my life. And when I
//left that dojo eight months later - which was not nearly enough time, but was
//all I could afford to spend - the Master told me that he hoped I understood why
//that had been necessary. And I told him that it was one of the most valuable
//lessons I had ever learned. Which was, and is, true.”

// 3472
//Professor Quirrell’s face turned bitter. “You are wondering where this
//marvelous __dojo__ is, and whether you can study there. You cannot. For
//not long afterward, another would-be student came to that hidden place, to that
//remote mountain. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”

// 3473
//There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in simultaneously. Harry felt
//sick to his stomach. He knew what was coming.

// 3474
//“The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise, glowing red eyes
//and all. The students tried to bar his way and he simply Apparated through.
//There was terror there, but discipline, and the Master came forth. And the Dark
//Lord demanded - not asked, but demanded - to be taught.”

// 3475
//Professor Quirrell’s face was very hard. “Perhaps the Master had read too many
//books telling the lie that a true martial artist could defeat even demons. For
//whatever reason, the Master refused. The Dark Lord asked why he could not be a
//student. The Master told him he had no patience, and that was when the Dark
//Lord ripped his tongue out.”

// 3476
//There was a collective gasp.

// 3477
//“You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush the Dark Lord and
//fell over, stunned where they stood. And then…”

// 3478
//Professor Quirrell’s voice faltered for a moment, then resumed.

// 3479
//“There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which produces
//unbearable pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer than a few minutes it
//produces permanent insanity. One by one, the Dark Lord Crucioed the Master’s
//students into insanity, and then finished them off with the Killing Curse,
//while the Master was forced to watch. When all his students had died in this
//way, the Master followed. I learned this from the single surviving student,
//whom the Dark Lord had left alive to tell the tale, and who had been a friend
//of mine…”

// 3480
//Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a moment later, he once
//again seemed calm and composed.

// 3481
//“Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers,” Professor Quirrell said quietly. “It
//is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and anyone who makes a habit of
//fighting them soon learns to rely on it. Understand that the Dark Lord did
//__not__ win that day. His goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left
//without a single lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wish that story retold.
//It did not show his strength, but rather an exploitable weakness.”

// 3482
//Professor Quirrell’s gaze focused on a single child in the classroom.

// 3483
//“Harry Potter,” Professor Quirrell said.

// 3484
//“Yes,” Harry said, his voice hoarse.

// 3485
//“What __precisely__ did you do wrong today, Mr. Potter?”

// 3486
//Harry felt like he was going to throw up. “I lost my temper.”

// 3487
//“That is __not__ precise,” said Professor Quirrell. “I will describe it
//more exactly. There are many animals which have what are called dominance
//contests. They rush at each other with horns - trying to knock each other down,
//not gore each other. They fight with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why
//with their claws sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a
//better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe their claws as
//well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest with a winner and a loser,
//both of them might be severely hurt.”

// 3488
//Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry from the repeater
//screen. “What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, is that - unlike those
//animals who keep their claws sheathed and accept the results - you do not know
//how to lose a dominance contest. When a __Hogwarts professor__ challenged
//you, you did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed
//your claws, heedless of the danger. You __escalated,__ and then you
//escalated __again.__ It started with a slap at you from Professor Snape,
//who was obviously dominant over you. Instead of losing, you slapped back and
//lost ten points from Ravenclaw. Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts.
//The fact that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow
//won at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot.”

// 3489
//“I understand,” Harry said. His throat was dry. That __had__ been precise.
//__Frighteningly__ precise. Now that Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry
//could see in hindsight that it was an __exactly__ accurate description of
//what had happened. When someone’s model of you was that good, you had to wonder
//whether they were right about other things too, like your intent to kill.

// 3490
//“The __next__ time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest
//rather than lose, you may lose __all__ the stakes you place on the table.
//I cannot guess what they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too
//high for the loss of ten House points.”

// 3491
//Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he’d done.

// 3492
//‘‘You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts, a much more
//important goal worthy of great risks. That is a __lie.__ If you had been
//-”

// 3493
//“I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best possible time to make
//my move,” Harry said, his voice hoarse. “But that would have meant
//__losing__. Letting him be dominant over me. It was what the Dark Lord
//couldn’t do with the Master he wanted to learn from.”

// 3494
//Professor Quirrell nodded. “I see that you have understood perfectly. And so,
//Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to lose.”

// 3495
//“I -”

// 3496
//“I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both that you need
//this and that you are strong enough to take it. I assure you that your
//experience will not be so harsh as what I went through, though you may well
//remember it as the worst fifteen minutes of your young life.”

// 3497
//Harry swallowed. “Professor Quirrell,” he said in a small voice, “can we do
//this some other time?”

// 3498
//“No,” Professor Quirrell said simply. “You are five days into your Hogwarts
//education and already this has happened. Today is Friday. Our __next__
//defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…
//No, we do __not__ have time to wait.”

// 3499
//There were a few laughs at this, but very few.

// 3500
//“Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter. What I would like
//to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any offensive spells, because I
//would then hear that you had severely hurt or even killed someone.
//Unfortunately I am told that your fingers are already powerful weapons. Do not
//snap them at any time during this lesson.”

// 3501
//More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.

// 3502
//Harry felt like he might cry. “Professor Quirrell, if you do anything like what
//you talked about, it’s going to make me angry, and I really would rather not
//get angry again today -”

// 3503
//“The point is __not__ to avoid getting angry,” Professor Quirrell said,
//his face looking grave. “Anger is natural. You need to learn how to lose even
//when you are angry. Or at least __pretend__ to lose so that you can
//__plan__ your vengeance. As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course
//any of you think he really __is__ better -”

// 3504
//“I’m not!” shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little frantic. “I know
//you didn’t really lose! Please don’t plan any vengeances!”

// 3505
//Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn’t know about his
//mysterious dark side. “Professor, we really need to talk about this after class
//-”

// 3506
//“We will,” Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise. “After you learn
//how to lose.” His face was serious. “It should go without saying that I will
//exclude anything which could injure you or even cause you significant pain. The
//pain will come from the difficulty of losing, instead of fighting back and
//escalating the battle until you win.”

// 3507
//Harry’s breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was more frightened than
//he’d been after leaving the Potions classroom. “Professor Quirrell,” he managed
//to say, “I don’t want you to get fired over this -”

// 3508
//“I will not be,” Professor Quirrell said, “if __you__ tell them afterward
//that it was necessary. And this I trust you to do.” For a moment Professor
//Quirrell’s voice turned very dry. “Believe me, they have tolerated worse in
//their hallways. This case will be exceptional only in that it happens within a
//classroom.”

// 3509
//“Professor Quirrell,” Harry whispered, but he thought his voice was still being
//repeated everywhere, “do you really believe that if I don’t do this, I might
//hurt someone?”

// 3510
//“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said simply.

// 3511
//“Then,” Harry felt nauseous, “I’ll do it.”

// 3512
//Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. “So… with the full approval
//of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape cannot be blamed for your
//actions… do any of you wish to show your dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived?
//Shove him around, push him to the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?”

// 3513
//Five hands went up.

// 3514
//“Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What part of
//__pretending__ to lose did you not understand? If Harry Potter does become
//the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down and kill you after he graduates.”

// 3515
//The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.

// 3516
//“I won’t,” Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. “I swear never to
//take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose. Professor Quirrell… would
//you __please__… __stop__ that?”

// 3517
//Professor Quirrell sighed. “I __am__ sorry, Mr. Potter. I realize that you
//must find this equally annoying whether you intend to become a Dark Lord or
//not. But those children __also__ had an important life lesson to learn.
//Would it be acceptable if I awarded you a Quirrell point in apology?”

// 3518
//“Make it two,” Harry said.

// 3519
//There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the tension.

// 3520
//“Done,” Professor Quirrell said.

// 3521
//“And after I graduate I’m going to hunt you down and __tickle__ you.”

// 3522
//There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn’t smile.

// 3523
//Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force the conversation
//through the narrow course that would make people realize he wasn’t a Dark Lord
//after all… __why__ was Professor Quirrell so suspicious of him?

// 3524
//“Professor,” said Draco’s unamplified voice. “It is also not my own ambition to
//become a stupid Dark Lord.”

// 3525
//There was a shocked silence in the classroom.

// 3526
//__You don’t have to do this!__ Harry almost blurted out loud, but checked
//himself in time; Draco might not wish it known that he was doing this out of
//friendship for Harry… or out of the desire to appear friendly…

// 3527
//Calling __that__ a __desire to appear friendly__ made Harry feel
//small, and mean. If Draco had intended to impress him, it was working
//perfectly.

// 3528
//Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. “__You__ worry that you
//cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw which describes Mr. Potter
//also describes you? __Surely__ your father taught you better.”

// 3529
//“When it comes to talking, maybe,” said Draco, now on the repeater screen. “Not
//when it comes to being shoved around and pushed to the ground. I want to be
//fully as strong as you, Professor Quirrell.”

// 3530
//Professor Quirrell’s eyebrows went up and stayed up. “I am afraid, Mr. Malfoy,”
//he said after a time, “that the arrangements I made for Mr. Potter, involving
//some older Slytherins who will be told __afterward__ how stupid they were,
//would not carry over onto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are
//already very strong. Should I hear that you have failed, as Mr. Potter failed
//today, I will make the appropriate arrangements and apologize to you and
//whomever you have hurt. I do not think this will be necessary, however.”

// 3531
//“I understand, professor,” said Draco.

// 3532
//Professor Quirrell looked over the class. “Does anyone else wish to become
//strong?”

// 3533
//Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought from his back row,
//looked like they were opening their mouths but not saying anything. In the end,
//no one spoke.

// 3534
//“Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year’s armies,” said
//Professor Quirrell, “should he deign to engage in that after-school activity.
//And now, Mr. Potter, please come forward.”

// 3535
//__Yes,__ Professor Quirrell had said, __it must be in front of
//everyone, in front of your friends, because that is where Snape confronted you
//and that is where you must learn to lose.__

// 3536
//So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence, and with requests
//from both Harry and the professor not to intervene. Hermione had her face
//turned away, but she hadn’t spoken out or even given him any sort of
//significant look, maybe because she’d been there in Potions too.

// 3537
//Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a Muggle dojo, which
//Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor for when Harry was pushed down.

// 3538
//Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell was right about
//his intent to kill…

// 3539
//Harry’s wand lay on Professor Quirrell’s desk, not because Harry knew any
//spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry thought) he might
//have tried to jam it through someone’s eye socket. His pouch lay there, now
//containing his protected but still potentially fragile Time-Turner.

// 3540
//Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him some boxing gloves
//and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell had given him a look of silent
//understanding, and refused.

// 3541
//__I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes, I will not
//go for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in Hogwarts, I’ll be
//arrested,__ Harry chanted to himself, trying to hammer the thought into his
//brain, hoping it would stay there if his intent to kill took over.

// 3542
//Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins of different
//years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he’d hit with a pie. Two others
//from that confrontation were also present. The one who’d said to stop, that
//they really shouldn’t do this, was missing.

// 3543
//“I repeat,” Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern, “Potter is
//__not__ to be really hurt. Any and all __accidents__ will be treated
//as deliberate. Do you understand?”

// 3544
//The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.

// 3545
//“Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few pegs,” Professor
//Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the first-years understood.

// 3546
//By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front of the group.

// 3547
//“Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick. He is better
//than you and he is about to show you that.”

// 3548
//Derrick strode forward and Harry’s brain screamed discordantly, he must not run
//away, he must not fight back -

// 3549
//Derrick stopped an arm’s length away from Harry.

// 3550
//Harry wasn’t angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he beheld a teenage boy
//fully half a meter taller than himself, with clearly defined muscles, facial
//hair, and a grin of terrible anticipation.

// 3551
//“Ask him not to hurt you,” Professor Quirrell said. “Perhaps if he sees that
//you’re pathetic enough, he’ll decide that you’re boring, and go away.”

// 3552
//There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.

// 3553
//“Please,” Harry said, his voice faltering, “don’t, hurt, me…”

// 3554
//“That didn’t sound very sincere,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 3555
//Derrick’s smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very superior and…

// 3556
//…Harry’s blood temperature was dropping…

// 3557
//“Please don’t hurt me,” Harry tried again.

// 3558
//Professor Quirrell shook his head. “How in Merlin’s name did you manage to make
//that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one response you can possibly
//expect from Mr. Derrick.”

// 3559
//Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.

// 3560
//Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop himself, straightened
//up icily.

// 3561
//“Wrong,” said Professor Quirrell, “wrong, wrong, wrong.”

// 3562
//“You bumped into me, Potter,” Derrick said. “Apologize.”

// 3563
//“I’m sorry!”

// 3564
//“You don’t __sound__ sorry,” said Derrick.

// 3565
//Harry’s eyes widened in indignation, he __had__ managed to make that sound
//pleading -

// 3566
//Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands and knees.

// 3567
//The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry’s vision, not far away.

// 3568
//He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell’s real motives in teaching this
//so-called __lesson.__

// 3569
//A foot rested on Harry’s buttocks and a moment later Harry was pushed hard to
//the side, sending him sprawling on his back.

// 3570
//Derrick laughed. “This is __fun,__” he said.

// 3571
//All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing to the
//Headmaster’s office. That would be the end of this __Defense Professor__
//and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts and… Professor McGonagall would be angry
//about that, but…

// 3572
//(An image of Professor McGonagall’s face flashed before his eyes, she didn’t
//look angry, just sad -)

// 3573
//“Now tell him that he’s better than you, Potter,” said Professor Quirrell’s
//voice.

// 3574
//“You’re, better, than, me.”

// 3575
//Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his chest and shoved
//him back down to the mat.

// 3576
//The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action and their
//consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity. The fool wouldn’t be
//expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in the groin would stun him long
//enough for -

// 3577
//“Try again,” said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp motion Harry
//rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where stood his real enemy, the
//Defense Professor -

// 3578
//Professor Quirrell said, “You have no patience.”

// 3579
//Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a picture of a wizened
//old man with blood pouring from his mouth after Harry had ripped his tongue out
//-

// 3580
//A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then sat down on him,
//sending Harry’s breath whooshing out.

// 3581
//“Stop!” Harry screamed. “Please stop!”

// 3582
//“Better,” said Professor Quirrell. “That even sounded sincere.”

// 3583
//It __had__ been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening thing, it
//__had__ been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly, fear and cold anger both
//flushing through him -

// 3584
//“Lose,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 3585
//“I, lose,” Harry forced out.

// 3586
//“I like it,” Derrick said from on top of him. “Lose some more.”

// 3587
//Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of older Slytherins
//to another set of hands that shoved him again. Harry had long since passed the
//point of trying not to cry, and was now just trying not to fall down.

// 3588
//“What are you, Potter?” said Derrick.

// 3589
//“A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you’re b-better, than me, please stop
//-”

// 3590
//Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands not quite able
//to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then began struggling to his feet
//again -

// 3591
//“__Enough!__” said Professor Quirrell’s voice, sounding sharp enough to
//cut iron. “Step away from Mr. Potter!”

// 3592
//Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his blood, which had
//been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold satisfaction.

// 3593
//Then Harry collapsed to the mat.

// 3594
//Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older Slytherins.

// 3595
//“And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to explain to you as
//well,” finished Professor Quirrell.

// 3596
//Draco’s voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp as professor
//Quirrell’s, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had used to imitate his
//father, and it was saying things like __could have put Slytherin House in
//jeopardy__ and __who knows how many allies in this school alone __and
//__total lack of awareness, never mind cunning__ and__ dull thugs,
//useful for nothing but lackeys__ and something in Harry’s hindbrain, despite
//everything he knew, was designating Draco as an ally.

// 3597
//Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold, his mind
//utterly exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes’s song, but without the phoenix
//present he couldn’t remember the melody and when he tried to imagine it he
//couldn’t seem to think of anything except a bird chirping.

// 3598
//Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the older Slytherins
//they were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and struggled to sit up, “Wait,”
//Harry said, forcing the words out, “there’s something, I want, to say, to them
//-”

// 3599
//“Wait on Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said coldly to the departing
//Slytherins.

// 3600
//Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the direction of his
//classmates. He didn’t want to see how they were looking at him now. He didn’t
//want to see their pity.

// 3601
//So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still seemed to be in a
//state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread was on their faces.

// 3602
//His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the imagination of this
//moment, and went on pretending to lose.

// 3603
//Harry said, “No one will -”

// 3604
//“Stop,” said Professor Quirrell. “If that’s what I think it is, please wait
//until after they’re gone. They’ll hear about it later. We all have our lessons
//to learn, Mr. Potter.”

// 3605
//“All right,” Harry said.

// 3606
//“You. Go.”

// 3607
//The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.

// 3608
//“No one’s to take any revenge on them,” Harry said hoarsely. “That’s a request
//to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I had my lesson to learn, they
//helped me learn it, they had their lesson to learn too, it’s over. If you tell
//this story, make sure you tell that part too.”

// 3609
//Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.

// 3610
//“You lost,” said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the first time. It
//sounded strange coming from the professor, like his voice shouldn’t even be
//able to do that.

// 3611
//Harry __had__ lost. There had been moments when the cold anger had faded
//entirely, replaced by fear, and during those moments he’d begged the older
//Slytherins and he’d meant it…

// 3612
//“And are you yet alive?” said Professor Quirrell, still with that strange
//gentleness.

// 3613
//Harry managed to nod.

// 3614
//“Not all losing is like this,” said Professor Quirrell. “There are compromises
//and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to placate bullies. There is a
//whole art form to manipulating others by letting them be dominant over you. But
//first, losing must be __thinkable__. Will you remember how you lost?”

// 3615
//“Yes.”

// 3616
//“Will you be able to lose?”

// 3617
//“I… think so…”

// 3618
//“I think so too.” Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin hair almost
//touched the floor. “Congratulations, Harry Potter, you win.”

// 3619
//There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started all at once
//like a massive thunderclap.

// 3620
//Harry’s couldn’t keep the shock from his face. He risked a glance at his
//classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity but awe. The applause was
//coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and Hufflepuff and even Slytherin,
//probably because Draco Malfoy was applauding too. Some students were standing
//up from their chairs and half of Gryffindor was standing on their desks.

// 3621
//So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over him, feeling
//stronger, and maybe even a little healed.

// 3622
//Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took quite a while.

// 3623
//“Surprised, Mr. Potter?” Professor Quirrell said. His voice sounded amused.
//“You have just found out that the real world does not __always__ work like
//your worst nightmares. Yes, if you had been some poor anonymous boy being
//abused, then they would probably have respected you less afterward, pitied you
//even as they comforted you from their loftier perches. That __is__ human
//nature, I’m afraid. But __you__ they already know for a figure of power.
//And they saw you confront your fear and keep confronting it, even though you
//could have walked away at any time. Did you think less of __me__ when I
//told you that I had deliberately endured being spat upon?”

// 3624
//Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically clamped down. He
//didn’t trust this miraculous respect enough to start crying again in front of
//it.

// 3625
//“Your __extraordinary__ achievement in my class deserves an extraordinary
//reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my compliments on behalf of my
//House, and remember from this day forward that not all Slytherins are alike.
//There are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins.” Professor Quirrell was
//smiling quite broadly as he said this. “Fifty-one points to Ravenclaw.”

// 3626
//There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out among the Ravenclaw
//students, howling and whistling and cheering.

// 3627
//(And in the same moment Harry felt something __wrong__ about that,
//Professor McGonagall had been right, there __should__ have been
//consequences, there should have been a cost and a price to be paid, you
//couldn’t just put everything back the way it was like that -)

// 3628
//But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn’t possibly say
//no.

// 3629
//His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry could not even
//believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let alone producing good
//suggestions.

// 3630
//“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, as clearly as he could through his burning
//throat. “You are everything a member of your House should be, and I think you
//must be just what Salazar Slytherin had in mind when he helped found Hogwarts.
//I thank you and your House,” Draco was very slightly nodding and subtly turning
//his finger, __keep going__, “and I think this calls for three cheers for
//Slytherin. With me, everyone?” Harry paused. “__Huzzah!__” Only a few
//people managed to join in on the first try. ”__Huzzah!__” This time most
//of Ravenclaw was in on it. ”__Huzzah!__” That was almost all of Ravenclaw,
//a scattering of Hufflepuffs and around a quarter of Gryffindor.

// 3631
//Draco’s hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.

// 3632
//Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few were staring at
//Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was looking at Harry with a
//calculating, intrigued expression.

// 3633
//Professor Quirrell bowed. “Thank __you__, Harry Potter,” he said, still
//with that broad smile. He turned to the class. “Now, believe it or not, we
//still have half an hour left in this session, and that is enough to introduce
//the Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, of course, is going off and taking a well-earned
//rest.”

// 3634
//“I can -”

// 3635
//“Idiot,” Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already laughing. “Your
//classmates can teach you afterward, or I’ll tutor you privately if that’s what
//it takes. But __right now__, you’re going through the third door from the
//left in the back of the stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of
//exceptionally tasty snacks, and some extremely light reading from the Hogwarts
//library. You may not take anything else with you, particularly not your
//textbooks. Now go.”

// 3636
//Harry went.
